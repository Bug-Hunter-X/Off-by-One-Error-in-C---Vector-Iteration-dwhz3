# Off-by-One Error in C++ Vector Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The error arises from incorrectly using the `<=` operator in the loop condition, leading to an out-of-bounds access.

The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides the corrected code. 

This example highlights the importance of careful loop condition design when working with arrays and vectors in C++.
